				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chargebacks consume more company dollars, which means strict compliance is key. Instituting a few best practices can help suppliers keep chargebacks at a minimum:</p>
<p><span id="more-26351"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Know customers&#8217; requirements and monitor changes. </strong>Customers usually publish vendor requirements manuals and routing guides on their websites and expect vendors to check for changes on a regular basis. It’s also a good idea to keep up with the Vender Compliance Federation. The manufacturer-distributor-reseller organization created a “compliance clearinghouse” of data from 155 major retailers, and regularly publishes changes to their routing and vendor guides (<a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/get-in-charge-of-your-chargebacks-6464302-1.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AllBusiness.com</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Appoint a dedicated compliance professional </strong>to attend vendor trainings and seminars, disseminate requirements to your team, update requirements in your systems, investigate problems to avoid recurrences, and maintain ongoing communication with 3PLs and other members of the supply chain. This team member can also respectfully contest erroneous chargebacks, and negotiate refunds based on past compliance history and steps taken toward improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Be proactive.</strong> Inform key team members of chargebacks to mitigate problems, identify and fix underlying issues, and get buy-in for continuous improvements. Timely and ongoing communication with customers is critical for demonstrating your commitment to their business requirements and overall success.</li>
<li><strong>Partner with experts. </strong> Your partners should have a big-picture understanding of your supply chain and work collaboratively with you to avoid problems. Transportation providers should have extensive experience delivering into your retail customers, with a solid on-time performance track record. Leveraging successful reporting and forecasting tools is another way partners can give you peace of mind that your shipments will be delivered hassle-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>In several ways, taking steps to avoid chargebacks benefits supply chain performance. In addition to maintaining profits for customers and suppliers, it also strengthens customer relationships. That encourages repeat business and referrals and can even position suppliers for better terms.</p>
<p>Chargeback Recovery Logistics Inc. understands that non-compliance with retailer requirements is costly. We help companies collect chargebacks and decrease dilution rate, and because we work on a contingency basis, we only get paid if we succeed on your behalf. Our cross-functional team of highly trained chargeback specialists can enhance the efforts you are already making, working with your existing chargeback management department and maximizing chargeback recovery. In today’s environment, companies are becoming overwhelmed with the growing challenges of retailers’ policies. Chargeback recovery relies on multiple, cross-functional teams, including customer sales, account management, accounting, logistics and production, working in close collaboration.</p>
<p>With diligent and persistent efforts, we pinpoint instances where chargebacks have either been assessed in error or unnecessarily, and we negotiate with retailers on your behalf. We can also help to eliminate many future chargebacks. Remember, even if you already have a chargeback team in your organization, you will only gain when you let us help you. The experience we bring to the process can maximize your chargeback recovery rate, and at no additional cost to you.</p>
